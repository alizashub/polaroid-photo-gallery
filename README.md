HTML &amp; CSS project to practice layout design 
# My Very First Project: HTML & CSS Experiment

This is my very first project where I’m learning and experimenting with HTML and CSS.  
I’m mainly exploring how flexboxes work and getting comfortable with layouts.

This is not a final or polished project—just a fun experiment!  
I plan to keep updating it as I learn more.

### Upcoming Features to Look Out For:
- Allow users to upload their own photographs  
- Add a toggle between *Retro Mode* and *Modern Mode* for different visual styles   

Thanks for checking it out!  
I’m excited to keep building and improving this project.
